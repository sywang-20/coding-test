1.linear_regression_vif.ipynb

Deal with multicollinearity using VIF and apply multiple linear regression

2.random_forest.ipynb

Apply Random Forest and to find the best value of the number of trees

3.tree_method.ipynb

Apply Random Forest(to include more hyperparameters) and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree

4.knn(to do)

test knn and pay attention to data normalization(make some comparisons) since distance function is used and knn is sensitive to scale

## Part 2: Classification

data_preparation_for_classification.ipynb: create new dataset according to the value of PM2.5 to test classification algorithms
