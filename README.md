## Part 1: Regression

***1-1.linear_regression_vif.ipynb***

Deal with multicollinearity using VIF and apply multiple linear regression

***1-2.random_forest.ipynb***

Apply Random Forest and to find the best value of the number of trees

***1-3.tree_method.ipynb***

Apply Random Forest(to include more hyperparameters) and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree

***1-4.knn***

Apply knn and pay attention to data normalization(**make some comparisons(haven't test)**) since distance function is used and knn is sensitive to scale

## Part 2: Classification

***data_preparation_for_classification.ipynb***

create new dataset according to the value of PM2.5 to test classification algorithms
